A native Android application for using the Atlantic Risk-Based Corrective Action (ARBCA) Tier I Risk-Based Screening Levels. Users can input laboratory analytical results and site conditions (land use, groundwater use, and soil type) to determine whether concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons in soil and groundwater exceed the Tier I RBSLs. Alternatively, given site conditions but no laboratory analytical results, users are provided with the RBSLs applicable to the site.
